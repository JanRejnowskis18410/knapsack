# Knapsack â€“ brute force

Implementation of knapsack problem using brute force method using characteristic vectors. 
The algorithm finds the maximum total value of items that total weight do not exceed the 
maximum capacity of a knapsack.

## Input data
First line in a file is the maximum capacity of a knapsack, next lines contains the 
value and weight of an object that may be packed in a knapsack.

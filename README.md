# Knapsack â€“ brute force

Implement solution of knapsack problem using brute force method. Generate characteristic
vectors and find the maximum total value of items that total weight do not exceed the
maximum capacity of a knapsack.
First line in a file is the maximum capacity of a knapsack, next lines contains the 
value and weight of an object that may be packed in a knapsack.
Print the solution: characteristic vector, total value and total weight of items in a knapsack.
Optional: print execution time of your algorithm.
